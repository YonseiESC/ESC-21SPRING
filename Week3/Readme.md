1. BDA Chapter 2 Exercise 8: 

Normal distribution with unknowm mean: a random sample of n students is drawn from a large population,
and their weights are measured. The average weight of the n sampled students is (중략)

(a) Give your posterior distribution for theta. 

(b) A new student is sampled at random from the same population and has a weight of (중략)

(c) For n=10, give a 95% posterior interval for theta, and a 95% posterior predictive interval for \tilde(y)

(d) Do the same for n=100
